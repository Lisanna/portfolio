## ðŸš€ Quick Start (local development) <a name="quickstart-local"></a>

This quick start assumes that you are starting from scratch.
If you already have an existing Angular project on GitHub, skip step 1 and 2.

1. Install the latest version of the Angular CLI globally
   and create a new Angular project.

   ```sh
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ng new your-angular-project --defaults
   cd your-angular-project
   ```

2. By default the Angular CLI initializes a Git repository for you.  
   To add a new remote for GitHub, use the `git remote add` command:

   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git
   ```

   Hints:

  - Create a new empty GitHub repository first.
  - Replace `<username>` and `<repositoryname>` with your username from GitHub and the name of your new repository.
  - Please enter the URL `https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git` into your browser â€“ you should see your existing repository on GitHub.
  - Please double-check that you have the necessary rights to make changes to the given project!

3. Add `angular-cli-ghpages` to your project.

   ```sh
   ng add angular-cli-ghpages
   ```

4. Deploy your project to GitHub pages with all default settings.
   Your project will be automatically built in production mode.

   ```sh
   ng deploy --base-href=/<repositoryname>/
   ```

   Which is the same as:

   ```sh
   ng deploy your-angular-project --base-href=/<repositoryname>/
   ```

   Please be aware of the `--base-href` option. It is necessary when your project will be deployed to a non-root folder. See more details below.

5. Your project should be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repositoryname>`.
